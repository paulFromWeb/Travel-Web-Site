## Technology.

### JS MODULES

At first, JavaScript programs were small - in the old days they were used for isolated tasks, adding a bit of interactivity to web pages if necessary, so large scripts were mostly not required. Several years have passed, and now we are already seeing full-blown applications running in browsers and containing a lot of JavaScript code; in addition, the language began to be used in other contexts (for example, Node.js).

### SASS(SCSS)
Sass is a preprocessor language based on CSS scripts. This language is used to interact with styles. The purpose of the application: to simplify and structure the code, as well as to make programming more convenient.

### JSON-SERVER

The REST API can be the back end of any mobile or web application. Often during development, the REST API is simply not ready. To see a mobile or web application in action, you need a server that will return random data in JSON format.

This is where the fake REST API comes in handy. The json-server tool has a set of necessary functionality so that you can easily set up a fake REST API server.


### Building with Webpack and Babel


## Project setup

```
npm install
json-server --watch db.json
```
